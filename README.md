# Vision-Visual-Language-Models-for-Sign-Language-Detection
Vision (Visual) Language Models for Sign Language static and dynamic detection 


This project implements real-time and video-based Sign Language Recognition (SLR) using CLIP and transformer-based temporal models. It supports static signs, compound gestures, and domain adaptation for low-resource sign languages like Egyptian Sign Language (ESL).
